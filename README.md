Important
=========
pydiskcmd remove pydiskhealthd in version 0.3.0, it may become a separate project 
in the future. For the reason: Need more effort to maintain a mixed-function project, 
and pydiskhealthd need more dependencies.

If you still want to use it, keep your tool version less than 0.3.0.


pydiskcmd
=========
pydiskcmd is a disk command tool for python3. It can send command to SATA/SAS/NVMe 
disk, as also as monitor the disk health.

In Linux, there is some tools to handle disk, like hdparm,smartctl,nvme-cli 
and etc. But I still hope to develop a tool to cover all the sata,sas,nvme disks.
It should be easily installed and should be able to send raw commands to target 
disks, provide a high-level API to build raw command with different protocal. 
Besides, it could monitor the health of the disks, especially take full advantage 
of NVMe(which offer a better monitoring mechanism). 

While in Windows, rarely find out an open source user level disk tool. I hope it 
is convenient to handle a disk in windows as if it is in Linux.

This project is more of a code collection, it was born and grow in the open source 
projects from github.

Why pydiskcmd
-------------
The pydiskcmd is easily installed. In most case, all you need is the python environment(
sometimes python-devel is need) and python module Cython. Benefit from python
(a cross-platform and high-level programming language) and OS level ioctl support, installing 
pydiskcmd Does Not need to configure the compiling environment(like C/C++ code). The 
long-term work in the development is to reduce the sofware dependency, to make installation 
as simple as possible.

The pydiskcmdlib provides a flexible and friendly middle-level API, as well as some low-level 
components to use. With the help of it, user could build their own raw command, send it to 
device and get the result. To archive this goal, more detailed documentation may be considered 
in the future. Whether you hope to test your storage device in protocal test or want to develop 
a disk utility tool, pydiskcmdlib will be a good choice.

pydiskcmdcli(pynvme/pysata/pyscsi included) is different with hdparm,sdparm and etc. The above 
tools is more like a command utility for a certain purpose, the pydiskcmdcli provides raw-command 
from spec without union. For example, the user cannot directly set the write-caching by the client 
tool, the equivalent command will be set-feature or mode-select.

Disadvantages
-------------
Compared to the compiled language, python code may take up more time and memory to run, and need 
more size in packaged program(i.e. program packaged by pyinstaller). Most of the time is consumed 
by loading the code in first use.

| Test item             | Used Time(milliseconds) | Description                   |
|-----------------------|-------------------------| ----------------------------- |
| Load pydiskcmdlib     | 35.99839                | Only load module pydiskcmdlib |
| Load pydiskcmdcli     | 36.59582                | Only load module pydiskcmdcli |

The test uses CentOS Stream 9 with python 3.9, and get the average value in 5 times.
